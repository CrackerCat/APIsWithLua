# Creating Solid APIs with Lua

*Lua and C code examples that illustrate C/Lua integration.*

These code samples were written as companions to the O'Reilly
book
![*Creating Solid APIs with Lua*](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/creating-solid-apis/9781491986301/).
The samples are built up chapter-by-chapter, and focus on a particular
game called *EatyGuy*, which looks like this:

This game is text-based in order to enable simple graphics that work across
platforms yet don't require any libraries.

Run `make` from the root repo directory to build all the examples.
The built products are created in each chapter's directory
(`ch1`, `ch2`, and so on). The game examples can be run by, for
example, in `ch6`, typing the command `./eatyguy10` (each chapter
has its own version of the game).
Use the arrow keys to move your character around, and press `q` to quit.

Many more details are provided in the book! :)
